# Review-analysis

This is a web app created using JustPy, a Python library for building web interfaces, that displays graphs for course review analysis.

#Usage
To use the app, simply run the app() function from main.py using Python. This will start a web server that serves the app at http://localhost:8000.

python main.py

Once the app is running, you can access it in your web browser by visiting http://localhost:8000.

#Features
The app currently displays the following graphs for course review analysis:

Average rating per day, week, and month: This graph shows the average rating for each day, week, and month based on the available reviews data.

Happiest day: This graph shows the day with the highest average rating.

Pie chart: This graph shows the distribution of ratings across the available reviews data.

#Future Work
Future versions of the app may include additional features and graphs, such as:

Sentiment analysis: This feature could use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews data and visualize the results.

Recommendations: This feature could use collaborative filtering techniques to recommend courses based on a user's reviews and preferences.

User authentication: This feature could allow users to create accounts and log in to the app, which would enable personalized recommendations and reviews.
